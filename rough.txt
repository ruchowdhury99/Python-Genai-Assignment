Based on the provided context, I was unable to extract the required points as the context seems to be incomplete and repetitive. However, I can provide a possible interpretation of the given information.

Assuming the context is referring to the Leave Management System (LMS) and Pods, here's a possible extraction of the requirements in JSON format:

```json
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "path": "/expense",
      "method": "POST",
      "params": ["employee_id", "expense_amount", "supporting_documents"],
      "description": "Submit expense with valid supporting documents"
    },
    {
      "path": "/expense",
      "method": "GET",
      "params": ["employee_id"],
      "description": "Retrieve expense history for a specific employee"
    }
  ],
  "logic": "The system should allow employees to submit expenses after completing training modules. The system should validate the submitted expenses and ensure they have valid supporting documents. The system should also allow managers to view and approve/deny expenses.",
  "schema": {
    "tables": [
      {
        "name": "employees",
        "columns": ["employee_id", "name", "email"]
      },
      {
        "name": "expenses",
        "columns": ["expense_id", "employee_id", "expense_amount", "status"]
      },
      {
        "name": "supporting_documents",
        "columns": ["document_id", "expense_id", "document_type"]
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "table1": "employees",
        "table2": "expenses",
        "relationship_type": "one-to-many"
      },
      {
        "table1": "expenses",
        "table2": "supporting_documents",
        "relationship_type": "one-to-many"
      }
    ],
    "constraints": [
      {
        "table": "expenses",
        "column": "status",
        "constraint_type": "enum",
        "values": ["pending", "approved", "denied"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "auth": "The system should use a combination of username/password and role-based access control to authenticate and authorize users. Employees should have read-only access to their own expense history, while managers should have read-write access to all expenses."
}
```

Please note that this is a possible interpretation and may not accurately reflect the actual requirements. The provided context is incomplete and repetitive, making it difficult to extract accurate requirements.
